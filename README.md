In general, supervised learning needs enough amount of labeled data to train the model, which achieves quite a high accuracy though wastes too much time and human power to annotate; on the other side, unsupervised learning doesn't need labeled data, ends up to a lower score compared with supervised learning. Talking about dataset, ...

## Introduction

We noticed that the dataset used by Keyword Extraction are mostly from scientific articles or newspaper, which are highly structured and clean. They are indeed great and direct resources to be used as samples and training set. However, data, news, information, texts, are unstructured and with noises in daily world. How to make best use of these data became the problem we want to solve.
